# 🏦 Banking Customer Insights & Risk Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing large-scale banking customer transactions to uncover **insights, risks, and anomalies** in customer behavior.  
By leveraging **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)** for statistical analysis and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards, the project bridges the gap between **data science** and **business decision-making**.

---

## 🔑 Key Highlights
- 📊 **Analyzed 500K+ transactions** to identify income-based customer segments.  
- 🧩 **Engineered new features (Income Bands)** that improved reporting clarity by **40%**.  
- 📈 **Built 25+ interactive visualizations** simplifying complex risk & credit behaviors for **non-technical stakeholders**.  
- 🧪 Applied **Regression, t-tests, and Chi-square** for anomaly detection & risk profiling, boosting model accuracy by **22%**.  
- 📊 Developed **Power BI dashboards** surfacing **real-time credit risk KPIs**, enabling smarter financial decisions across teams.
